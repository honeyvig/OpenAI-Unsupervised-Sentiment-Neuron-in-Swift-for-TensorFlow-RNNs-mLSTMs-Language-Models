# OpenAI-Unsupervised-Sentiment-Neuron-in-Swift-for-TensorFlow-RNNs-mLSTMs-Language-Models
Building an Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron model, like the one demonstrated by OpenAI using RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks), and Language Models, in Swift for TensorFlow involves setting up a framework that can efficiently process sequences of text data (such as tweets, product reviews, or movie reviews) and predict the sentiment associated with the text, without any explicit supervision.

While it's complex to replicate exactly OpenAI's Sentiment Neuron (which is fine-tuned on a large dataset of sentences labeled by sentiment), we can create a simplified version of an LSTM-based model to process text and predict sentiment using Swift for TensorFlow.

Below is the basic setup for an Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron using LSTM-based models in Swift for TensorFlow. Note that Swift for TensorFlow is no longer actively maintained, but you can still use it for educational and experimental purposes.
Steps:

    Install Swift for TensorFlow: Ensure you have Swift for TensorFlow set up. You can follow the installation instructions here.
    Set up the LSTM Model: We will use an LSTM model to process the sequence of words in a sentence.
    Sentiment Prediction: We'll train the model with a dataset containing labeled text to predict sentiment (positive/negative).

Hereâ€™s a basic Swift code implementing an LSTM-based Sentiment Neuron:
Code for Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron in Swift for TensorFlow

import TensorFlow
import Foundation

// LSTM-based Sentiment Model
struct SentimentModel: Layer {
    var embedding: Embedding<Float>
    var lstmCell: LSTMCell<Float>
    var dense: Dense<Float>
    
    init(vocabSize: Int, embeddingDim: Int, hiddenSize: Int) {
        self.embedding = Embedding(vocabularySize: vocabSize, embeddingSize: embeddingDim)
        self.lstmCell = LSTMCell(inputSize: embeddingDim, hiddenSize: hiddenSize)
        self.dense = Dense(inputSize: hiddenSize, outputSize: 1)
    }
    
    @differentiable
    func callAsFunction(_ input: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float> {
        // Apply word embeddings
        let embedded = embedding(input)
        
        // Use LSTM to process the sequence of words
        var lstmState = LSTMCell<Float>.State()
        let (output, _) = lstmCell(embedded, state: lstmState)
        
        // Take the final LSTM output and pass through a dense layer to predict sentiment
        return dense(output)
    }
}

// Helper functions to prepare data
func preprocessData(_ text: [String]) -> Tensor<Float> {
    // Convert text to integer sequence (word indexes)
    // For simplicity, let's assume we have a simple word-to-index mapping
    let wordToIndex: [String: Int] = ["good": 1, "bad": 2, "happy": 3, "sad": 4]
    
    var sequences = [[Int]]()
    for sentence in text {
        let words = sentence.split(separator: " ").map { String($0) }
        let sequence = words.compactMap { wordToIndex[$0] }
        sequences.append(sequence)
    }
    
    // Convert to Tensor
    return Tensor<Float>(sequences)
}

// Training loop
func trainModel(model: inout SentimentModel, data: [String], labels: [Int], epochs: Int) {
    let optimizer = Adam(for: model)
    
    for epoch in 1...epochs {
        var totalLoss: Float = 0
        for (i, sentence) in data.enumerated() {
            let input = preprocessData([sentence])
            let label = Tensor<Float>([Float(labels[i])])
            
            let (prediction, grad) = valueWithGradient(at: model) { model -> Tensor<Float> in
                let output = model(input)
                let loss = meanSquaredError(predicted: output, expected: label)
                return loss
            }
            
            optimizer.update(&model, along: grad)
            totalLoss += totalLoss
        }
        
        print("Epoch \(epoch): Loss = \(totalLoss)")
    }
}

// Example data (for simplicity)
let sentences = ["good movie", "bad movie", "happy day", "sad day"]
let sentimentLabels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  // 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative

// Initialize the model
let vocabSize = 10000  // Example vocabulary size
let embeddingDim = 50  // Embedding dimension
let hiddenSize = 128  // LSTM hidden size
var model = SentimentModel(vocabSize: vocabSize, embeddingDim: embeddingDim, hiddenSize: hiddenSize)

// Train the model
trainModel(model: &model, data: sentences, labels: sentimentLabels, epochs: 10)

// Evaluate the model
let testSentence = "good day"
let testInput = preprocessData([testSentence])
let prediction = model(testInput)
print("Sentiment prediction for '\(testSentence)': \(prediction)")

Explanation:

    SentimentModel:
        We define an LSTM-based model using Embedding, LSTMCell, and Dense layers.
        The model takes sequences of words (encoded as integer indices), passes them through an embedding layer, and processes the sequence with an LSTM layer.
        The output of the LSTM is then passed through a dense layer to predict the sentiment (positive/negative).

    Preprocess Data:
        The preprocessData function takes raw sentences and maps each word to an integer based on a simple dictionary (word-to-index). For a more realistic implementation, you'd use a more sophisticated tokenizer or pretrained embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec.

    Training Loop:
        The training function uses the Adam optimizer to update the model weights. The loss is calculated using mean squared error, and we update the model parameters with each iteration.

    Example Sentences:
        We define some simple example sentences along with sentiment labels: 1 for positive sentiment and 0 for negative sentiment.

    Evaluation:
        After training, the model is used to predict the sentiment of a test sentence.

Notes:

    Model Complexity: This is a simple LSTM-based model, and real-world models typically use pretrained embeddings and more complex preprocessing steps.
    Swift for TensorFlow: The Swift ecosystem is not as mature as Python for deep learning, so certain functions and libraries may not be as optimized or fully supported.
    Sentiment Neuron: The original OpenAI's sentiment neuron is trained on a large corpus and fine-tuned for specific use cases. This is a simplified version.

Conclusion:

This code provides a basic implementation of a sentiment analysis model using an LSTM in Swift for TensorFlow. For real-world applications, you may need a much larger dataset, better text preprocessing, and more complex architectures like Transformers (BERT, GPT, etc.).
